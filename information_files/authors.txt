This game was created as a project to practise Python and to create something interesting that I could enjoy (and the others as well)
Repository is public to share with people what I've done and to share this game with people that want to play.
I have all rights to the code but I don't raise any money based on this project (since it was partially inspired by others' work (anime and game)
